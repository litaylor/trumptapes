          <p>The released recording of Donald Trump describing grabbing and kissing women without their consent divided his supporters and spurred a national conversation about sexual assault. At UNC-Chapel Hill, a hotbed for activism against sexual assault on campus, students were particularly critical of the Republican presidential nominee.</p>
          <p>On October 7, the Washington Post released audio of Trump saying he can&rsquo;t resist kissing beautiful women, and said he has special status with them because he is a celebrity.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>Ferrel Guillory, a professor in the UNC School of Media and Journalism, said he had a personal experience of how explosive Trump&rsquo;s comments were going to be early on.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;My children and grandchildren come over for dinner on Friday nights. So at 6:30 I turned on the national news to see what the hubbub was about. And my daughter yelled at me &lsquo;turn it off,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was sitting next to her 14-year-old and he hadn&rsquo;t seen it yet and she wanted to talk to him about it before.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He said his first impression was that Trump&rsquo;s comments were out of bounds and not words one would want a teenager to hear.</p>
          <p>Since the scandal broke, 11 women have publicly accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior, including assault.</p>
          <p>Jada Harkins Andrews, a junior at UNC-CH double-majoring in journalism and political science, said men generally don&rsquo;t make comments like Trump&rsquo;s and that such talk encourages the objectification of women.</p>
          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/jada-people-try.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">&ldquo;This is very much the kind of behavior that encourages that it&rsquo;s okay to speak that way about women as objects.&rdquo;</span></p>

          <p>Republican leaders House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have withdrawn their support, expressing disdain for Trump&rsquo;s comments.</p>
          <p>Guillory said this has raised a question of support for the party in this election.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;They instinctively want to support the candidate of their party. And there&rsquo;s good reason in the political dynamics of American Politics that you support your party,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what Trump has done is raise the question of support for the party as the be all and end all, or whether otherwise ethical, upstanding political figures should renounce their party&rsquo;s nominee because of the clear defects of their character.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>That question isn&rsquo;t just for Republican Party leaders. The UNC College Republicans has grappled with the same issue. Hayden Vick, the group&rsquo;s chairman, said it has a tough job during this election.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say throughout history you could find examples where Republicans who didn&rsquo;t like the nominee could find ways to like Democratic nominee. Right now, we&rsquo;re looking at two nominees who so many in their own parties have disdain for,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>The group has made no official endorsement because some members support Trump as the nominee and others don&rsquo;t.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure we don&rsquo;t isolate members who love him, but we also recognize that many members don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; Vick said. &ldquo;At the end of the day, we have an obligation to our members before we have an obligation to the rest of the state or to Donald Trump.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The group&rsquo;s executive board denounced Trump&rsquo;s comments in a statement released five days after the video came out but said it will continue to fight for conservative values and those who promote them.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Mr. Trump&rsquo;s words were, in every way, inadmissible, and we do not make, nor support, any justification on his behalf&hellip; There is no excuse, there is no explanation, there is only regret as we distance ourselves from the words of the Republican nominee,&rdquo; the executive board said in the release.</p>
          <p>Vick said he doesn&rsquo;t agree with the justification that the comments were just &ldquo;locker room talk.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When I hear things like that, it&rsquo;s not locker room talk. What he was saying was geared a lot more towards sexual assault than it was towards harmless, guy joking,&rdquo; he said.</p>

          <p>Joshua Asiko, a UNC-CH senior majoring in psychology,&nbsp;<span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/joshua-hes-a-fool.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">said</span> such talk is not a healthy way to regard women or sexual encounters.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I guess what he&rsquo;s trying to say is that boys will be boys, but that&rsquo;s just not enough of a defense. Who you are there is who you are all the time. So if he&rsquo;s using that as a justification, I don&rsquo;t think that holds up at all,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>Asiko said any culture that allows this kind of language perpetuates the unsafety of women.</p>
          <p>UNC-CH has faced loud criticism over how it handles sexual assault for the past few years. In 2012, Landen Gambill went public with allegations that her ex-boyfriend sexually abused her and that the university treated her unfairly throughout the investigation of her claims.</p>
          <p>Gambill and four other women, including a former administrator, filed a Title IX complaint against the university in January 2013. In the complaint, they said the university pressured the former administrator to underreport the number of sexual assaults to the federal government.</p>
          <p>UNC-CH was one of the initial 55 colleges under investigation by the Department of Education for Title IX violations in May 2014.</p>
          <p>Since that time, the university created a new policy on discrimination, harassment and related misconduct.</p>
          <p>Yet the criticism continues.</p>
          <p>In a September press conference, UNC-CH sophomore Delaney Robinson said in a press conference she survived an alleged sexual assault at an on-campus apartment complex in February 2016.</p>
          <p>She said she cooperated with law enforcement by allowing a rape kit to be taken and giving a statement. However she said, the university and the Title IX office have done nothing six months after her assault.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I did not realize that rather than receiving support and concern from the University, I would only be further victimized by the people who should be working to keep us safe,&rdquo; Robinson said in a release.</p>
          <p>Robinson sought two self-sworn warrants of misdemeanor assault on a female and sexual battery and against Allen Artis, a former UNC linebacker.</p>
          <p>After Artis was charged, his lawyer, Kerry Sutton, said Artis couldn&rsquo;t possibly get a fair hearing in the Title IX process.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;This has been manipulated sadly, poorly, horrifically so that this young man has had the arc of his life altered,&rdquo; Sutton said in a press conference.</p>
          <p>The accusations made national news and sparked outrage and intense debate. UNC-CH senior Hannah Petersen, a double-major in journalism and anthropology, said Robinson&rsquo;s account could have a silencing effect on students who have been raped.</p>
          <p>She said Robinson <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-p-im-disappointed-in-this-case-its-a-silencing-affect.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">followed the best procedures</span> to pursue a complaint. Petersen said she had less evidence after <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-p-how-the-unc-case-makes-her-feel-like-her-case-doesn't-matter.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">her own</span> sexual assault.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Watching [Robinson&rsquo;s] case not get pushed forward was just kind of like a slap, saying, &lsquo;you know what, cases like yours don't matter either,&rsquo; if she can't get the same results,&rdquo; she said.</p>
          <p>Most rigorous research has concluded that less than 10 percent of rape reports to law enforcement are false, according to the National Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women.</p>

          <p>Other students said Robinson&rsquo;s account of the university&rsquo;s response furthers an idea that athletes have a different set of standards.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;There is this idea of rape culture among, especially, college football players, and so there's this idea that athletes have a different sort of set of standards than most people do,&rdquo; said UNC-CH senior Caleb Waters, a journalism major.</p>
          <p>Senior Julia Whitfield said struggles to combat sexual assault are <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/julia-this-isnt-new-long-tired-story.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">far from new</span> and Robinson&rsquo;s statements should remind everyone to consider the meaning of consent.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Because we all understand consent when it means going to the doctor and the doctor's like, 'Read this. I'm going to do this procedure on you,' she said. &ldquo;And we get that, but we don't see how that can translate when it comes to sexual assault.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Whitfield also said students should be taught to drink responsibly and in moderation.</p>

              <p>UNC-CH senior and psychology major Hannah Beason, who said Trump&rsquo;s comments left her speechless, responded by enlisting friends to help her tie Carolina Blue <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-b-everything-has-ribbons.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">ribbons</span> into loops representing solidarity against sexual assault.</p>

              <p>UNC-CH senior John Aceti, a journalism major, said awareness of rape culture is important. He said if someone knows what perpetuates rape culture or promotes a negative image of women, they can point that out to other people.</p>
              <p>Aceti said sometimes people like to brag, and there can be a joking aspect to it, but Trump&rsquo;s comments aren&rsquo;t a joke.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;It doesn't make a lot of sense to me for it to be 'locker room talk,' because that's pretty explicit stuff that you don't expect to be heard or said anywhere,&rdquo; Aceti said.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Donald Trump&rsquo;s recent comments about women, more allegations of sexual assault have emerged and a nationwide discussion about sexual assault has dominated the headlines.</p>
          <p>These discussions have even made their way into dining room conversation. Ferrel Guillory, a professor in the UNC School of Media and Journalism, said he had a personal experience of how explosive Trump&rsquo;s comments were going to be early on.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;My children and grandchildren come over for dinner on Friday nights. So at 6:30 I turned on the national news to see what the hubbub was about. And my daughter yelled at me &lsquo;turn it off,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was sitting next to her 14-year-old and he hadn&rsquo;t seen it yet and she wanted to talk to him about it before.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>He said his first impression was that Trump&rsquo;s comments were out of bounds and not something you would want a teenager to hear.</p>
          <p>In a three-minute clip obtained by the Washington Post, Trump said he can&rsquo;t resist kissing beautiful women, and said he has special status with them because he is a celebrity.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,&rdquo; he said.</p>

            I don't know, I think the Allen Artis case is interesting, because there is this idea of rape culture among, especially, college football players, and so there's this idea that athletes have a different sort of set of standards, I guess, than most people do. I don't really, I guess, notice it all that much in normal, everyday life, you know. I hear a lot about it, but I don't think it's all that prevalent in everyday situations. But I think it's an interesting situation with football, especially.

            I think there definitely is a sort of collective mind when it comes to a bunch of guys together in one place talking about women. From my experience, in high school athletics and even middle school, there is definitely an environment where that's the place to brag about what you've done or anything, talk about girls. But I've never heard anything close to what Donald Trump said. I don't think that goes on at all, even in professional locker rooms.

            I don't know what locker rooms that Donald Trump has probably ever been in. As an incredibly rich person, he doesn't really - he probably has his own locker room to be honest with you. But yeah, I don't think that that's locker room talk at all.

            His excuse that they're locker room talk, I think, is bogus. That's just his way of covering up what he said. That's his way of not apologizing but looking like he's apologizing.

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-b-crossing-ribbons.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">I think just crossing those ribbons and knowing that every single time we crossed the ribbon, that ribbon could represent one girl that has suffered a sexual assault. And just knowing that, it may be something so small, but these are the kind of small things that start to ignite change. That's what we were hoping for.

            'Cancer has ribbons, everything has ribbons, so let's make ribbons!' I don't know, it was just a way for us and several friends, we all got around, we had an assembly going around of these ribbons. I think just making those ribbons and making it an outward expression that we're going to try to combat this.

            I want to believe that a lot of people talking about this don't believe it's sexual assault. Like, I want to believe people who think about sexual assault and are still talking about women this way are still thinking about sexual assault like, behind the bushes, grab you, hold a gun to your head and then do it. But the fact of the matter is, if you're not two consenting partners, or parties, it's rape. It's sexual assault.

            So even though I haven't suffered personally, I know my friends have suffered. I want to be a mother one day, and I don't want my daughter to ever suffer. So I think that was a big part for us, just realizing that this is an outward expression. Even though we haven't - we may have not been through it personally, this is an outward expression of us saying, 'We are with you.'

            Even though these were words, the way you talk about someone is the way you're going to treat someone. The way that you talk about the world is the way you're going to view the world, et cetera, et cetera. So the fact that he was able to say those things about an entire group of people, essentially, and just not have any repercussions is totally disheartening.

            Just to see people make excuses about it, I think is the hardest thing. Some people say, 'Oh, well if you disagree with Trump's quotes, then who the hell bought 50 million copies of Fifty Shades of Grey?'

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-b-we-have-a-narrow-vision-of-assault.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            We have such narrow, narrow vision of, like, you have to be sober, you have to be held at gunpoint, you have to be penetrated, in order for it to be sexual assault, and these are not, this is not the one right way to have sexual assault committed upon you and I think that is, like - changing that dialogue between anything that was not wanted, anything that was told to go away that you did not consent to it, like that, anything outside of that is sexual assault.

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-b-we-were-all-sitting-in-our-living-room-kitchen-area.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            We were all sitting in our living room kitchen area, and she was like, 'Have y'all heard this?' and we were like, 'No,' and she pulled it up. And I think, the first thing I remember about our reaction is that we were just silent. Like, how in the world is this happening, and nothing - and the world isn't in wars about it.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-p-good-conversation-but-trying-to-normalize-these-behaviors.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            There's been a lot of conversation, which is awesome, and that needs to happen, because that's the only way that we're going to be able to change this. But unfortunately, I've seen a lot of defense for it, too. As y'all already talked about, brushing it off as 'locker room talk.' And that to me is just one more attempt to try to normalize these kinds of behaviors.
          </span></p>

            In the back of my mind, I was like, if I had told anybody about this, would it have mattered? Would it have counted? Or would somebody have looked at me and been like 'We can't help you?' And so that says something like for the past couple years since the experience happened, that I've been dealing with, 'Does this matter?' And watching her case not get pushed forward was just kind of like a slap, saying, you know what, cases like yours don't matter either, if she can't get the same results.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-p-im-disappointed-in-this-case-its-a-silencing-affect.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            I'm very disappointed in the reaction to this case. Because, unlike so many others, Delaney did everything right. She went, she got her rape kit, she had images. She has, like, tangible proof that this assault happened, and still nothing's coming out of it. Whereas, there's so many other students on this campus that something's happened to along these similar lines, and they don't have those tangible elements of proof. And they're watching her case not get developed or heard any more, and so they're going to be turned down from talking about it. It's a silencing effect, in my opinion.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-p-initial-response.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            My initial response kind of was on a varied scale. I went from really, really angry, to really, really sad. My initial reaction was, 'How dare he say this, and how dare people still support this?' Just because, to me, it's such a place of privilege to be able to say those words, and to be able to support those words. Like, for me, it means, you don't have to think about this. You can walk around, and you're not worried that this is going to happen to you. And that you can, like, go out and not worry that somebody's going to slip something in your drink. Or that you don't have to second guess everything you're saying. And so I was really angry, at first, just upon hearing this, just because, that's where my thoughts were. Eventually it kind of turned to sad if that makes sense, as I saw how many people were still supporting it,  just because to me that reinforces the whole idea of rape culture and how normalized it's become in our society.

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-p-talking-about-how-her-sexual-assault-experience.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            It really impacted the way I looked at the Delaney case, just because my incident was alcohol-related, and therefore I didn't have the same amount of proof.
            I also was very quick to try to cover it up as much as I could. So, I didn't go to the hospital, like Delaney did. I went home. I tried to tell myself it didn't happen. I tried to wash every memory of it away. And so, I didn't have the same elements of proof that Delaney had. Further, a lot of the people I talked to right after it happened told me to not report, simply because, one, they didn't think anything come out of it, and two, I was told, 'You were maybe flirting,' 'Are you sure he didn't say yes,' stuff like that.

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/john-people-like-to-brag.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            There's definitely a culture-slash-maybe theme of conversation sometimes. People like to brag, things are said. There's a joking aspect of it. But then there's also kind of testosterone aspect, where it's just you put a lot of guys in a room, and they're going to talk about sex and all that.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/john-thats-stuff-you-dont-expect-to-hear.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            It doesn't make a lot of sense to me for it to be 'locker room talk,' because that's pretty explicit stuff that you don't expect to be heard or said anywhere.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/john-you-can-have-people-recognize-rape-culture.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            I mean, I think awareness of rape culture is definitely one step that can be taken. Because you can have people recognize when something being said fits in with rape culture or promotes this negative image of women, sexualization of women, et cetera, et cetera. And you can kind of call people on that.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/julia-calling-men-out.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            I think one thing that could help would be calling men out when they do slip up and say it in public. But not doing it in an angry way, just saying, 'Hey, do you realize what you said could lead to this, this and this?' Or how it would affect me as a woman.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/julia-this-isnt-new-long-tired-story.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            This isn't new. This has been going on for decades and centuries, in most cultures. It's a long, tired story, that I'm sick of hearing. But, it's important to point that out to people, too when they get upset, that we're all seeking justice and to be treated with human decency, which is always the argument. But yeah, treat everyone that way.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/julia-two-ways-to-fix-campus-culture.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            Well two things that need to be addressed are: teaching people what consent is. Because we all understand consent when it means going to the doctor and the doctor's like, 'Read this. I'm going to do this procedure on you.' And we get that, but we don't see how that can translate when it comes to sexual assault. So first, consent. And then the second thing is underage drinking. I know it's very common on a lot of campuses, but the excessive amounts of it. I'm not saying it's - well, I don't know how it could be stopped, because everyone is sort of guilty of underage drinking, but teaching people how to do it responsibly. Because then, a lot of times these much more dangerous and bigger cases come from, oh both people were intoxicated way past anything normal, or one person was, or whatever the case may be. So those two things are things that need to be addressed, too, because we sort of just look at sexual assault after the fact. We don't look at all the environmental or situational factors that come into play.
          </span></p>

          <p><span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/julia-when-a-boy-likes-you-he-teases.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">
            When children are young, not perpetuating the old storyline of, when a boy teases you, that just means he likes you, which can later play into rape culture or interpersonal violence. A lot of people see that as a stretch, but I really think it plays into that later, because you get conditioned.

And there&rsquo;s good reason in the political dynamics of American Politics that you support your party,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what Trump has done is raise the question of support for the party as the be all and end all, or whether otherwise ethical, upstanding political figures should renounce their party&rsquo;s nominee because of the clear defects of their character.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>This question isn&rsquo;t just for Republican Party leaders. UNC College Republicans have been grappling with the same issue. Hayden Vick, the group&rsquo;s chairman, said they have a tough job during this election.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say throughout history you could find examples where Republicans who didn&rsquo;t like the nominee could find ways to like Democratic nominee. Right now, we&rsquo;re looking at two nominees who so many in their own parties have disdain for,&rdquo; he said.</p>
          <p>The group hasn&rsquo;t made an official endorsement because they have members who support Trump as the nominee and others who don&rsquo;t.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure we don&rsquo;t isolate members who love him, but we also recognize that many members don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; Vick said. &ldquo;At the end of the day, we have an obligation to our members before we have an obligation to the rest of the state or to Donald Trump.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>The executive board of UNC College Republicans denounced Trump&rsquo;s comments in a statement released after the video was leaked. They said they will continue to fight for conservative values and those who promote them, but they repudiate the comments of the nominee.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Mr. Trump&rsquo;s words were, in every way, inadmissible, and we do not make, nor support, any justification on his behalf&hellip; There is no excuse, there is no explanation, there is only regret as we distance ourselves from the words of the Republican nominee,&rdquo; the executive board said in the release.</p>
          <p>Vick said he doesn&rsquo;t agree with the justification that the comments were just &ldquo;locker room talk.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When I hear things like that, it&rsquo;s not locker room talk. What he was saying was geared a lot more towards sexual assault than it was towards harmless, guy joking,&rdquo; he said.</p>

          <p>Sexual Assault is not an unfamiliar topic for students at UNC. In 2012, Landen Gambill went public with allegations that her ex-boyfriend sexually abused her, and the university treated her unfairly throughout the investigation of her claims.</p>
          <p>Gambill and four other women, including a former administrator, filed a Title IX complaint against the university in January 2013. In the complaint, they said the university pressured the former administrator to underreport the number of sexual assaults to the federal government.</p>

              <p>In September, sophomore Delaney Robinson said she survived a sexual assault at an on-campus apartment complex in February 2016.</p>
              <p>She said she cooperated by allowing a rape kit to be taken and gave a statement to law enforcement. However she said, the university and the Title IX office have done nothing six months after her assault.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;I did not realize that rather than receiving support and concern from the University, I would only be further victimized by the people who should be working to keep us safe,&rdquo; Robinson said in a release.</p>
              <p>Robinson sought two self-sworn warrants of misdemeanor assault on a female and sexual battery and against Allen Artis, a former UNC linebacker.</p>
              <p>After Artis was charged, his lawyer, Kerry Sutton, said Artis couldn&rsquo;t possibly get a fair hearing in the Title IX process.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;This has been manipulated sadly, poorly, horrifically so that this young man has had the arc of his life altered,&rdquo; Sutton said in a press conference.</p>
              <p>Some students are disappointed with how this case has been handled. Senior Hannah Petersen said this case has a silencing effect because there is tangible proof in this case but nothing has come of it.</p>

Because, unlike so many others, Delaney did everything right,&rdquo; Petersen said.</span></p>
              <p>Other students said this case presents an idea that athletes have a different set of standards. Senior Caleb Waters said this is an interesting case.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;There is this idea of rape culture among, especially, college football players, and so there's this idea that athletes have a different sort of set of standards than most people do,&rdquo; Waters said.</p>

          <p>Senior Julia Whitfield <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/julia-two-ways-to-fix-campus-culture.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">said</span> the idea of consent should be addressed.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Because we all understand consent when it means going to the doctor and the doctor's like, 'Read this. I'm going to do this procedure on you,' she said. &ldquo;And we get that, but we don't see how that can translate when it comes to sexual assault.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Whitfield also said underage drinking should be addressed. She said underage drinking is commonplace on a college campus, but students should be taught how to drink responsibly and not in excess.</p>
          <p>Sexual assault is a very personal issue for many students across UNC&rsquo;s campus. After Trump&rsquo;s comments about women, Hannah Beason and a group of her friends got together to <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/hannah-b-everything-has-ribbons.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">create ribbons</span> representing solidarity against sexual assault.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Every single time we crossed the ribbon, that ribbon could represent one girl that has suffered a sexual assault,&rdquo; Beason said.</p>
          <p>She said Trump&rsquo;s comments left her without words because it&rsquo;s hard to make excuses for comments like that.</p>
          <p>Senior John Aceti said awareness of rape culture is important. He said if someone knows what perpetuates rape culture or promotes a negative image of women, they can point that out to other people.</p>
          <p>Aceti said sometimes people like to brag, and there <span class="soundcite" data-url="audio/john-people-like-to-brag.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">can be a joking aspect to it</span>, but Trump&rsquo;s comments aren&rsquo;t a joke.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;It doesn't make a lot of sense to me for it to be 'locker room talk,' because that's pretty explicit stuff that you don't expect to be heard or said anywhere,&rdquo; Aceti said.</p>
